It is just a rough work. It's first time i'm coding in NodeJs so couldn't get more work done in 8 hours. The object 
structure yet needs to be fixed. Otherwise i think API is working correctly but front-end needs to be fixed. As i've to work on LIA 
Mobile app project so i'll be busy this week. Hopefully, I'll be working on this project next week.

Execution instructions:
Download this project. Open command prompt and navigate to the root of this project. 
run 'npm install', it should install all the dependencies
and then run 'npm start', it will start our server.

Then you can either test it on Postman, OR
Open the frontend.html in the folder frontend.

As i said, the front end needs a lot more code. so at the time, if you fill in all the fields and click submit, it'll add that data 
to the bundle.json file (can be replaced with mongodb in future)
